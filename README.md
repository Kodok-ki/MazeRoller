[OUTDATED - Please see the mazegen branch for the up-to-date version of the project]



Maze Roller

A project to try and implement a procedurally-generated maze algorithm in the form of a game.
The ProtoBuild shows off the purpose of the game which is to rotate (tilt) a maze in order to guide a ball from start to finish.
However, ProtoBuild has a premade maze, rather than a randomly-generated one.

In the mazegen branch of the project however, can create procedurally-generated. 
Unfortunately there isn't a build for this just yet as the game mechanics still need to be included in this branch of the code.
But the final build will be coming soon!
