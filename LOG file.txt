======================
-Initialised new Git repository (repo) for project.
-Pushed to remote server.
-Established a working branch (called "ProtoWorking") 
-Established a 10x10 (unity units) plane for first maze.
-Using cubes to create the maze walls.
-Created a new material to colour the maze walls.
-Built maze walls for prototype maze.
-Built separate 'start' and 'goal' areas. 
 -Includes creating two addtional materials to colour them.
-Created the script for managing the maze's rotations.
-Tested the ball's collisions by rotating the maze about the y-axis at 1 degree
 per frame for 1000 frames.
  -The ball 'jitters' while it's stuck in the rotation but has an appropriate velocity
   after the maze stops rotating.
-Need to create script for actually controlling the maze before building the scene and 
 pushing it to the remote repo (origin).
-Didn't commit any changes
