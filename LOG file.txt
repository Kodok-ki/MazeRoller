======================
-Initialised new Git repository (repo) for project.
-Pushed to remote server.
-Established a working branch (called "ProtoWorking") 
-Established a 10x10 (unity units) plane for first maze.
-Using cubes to create the maze walls.
-Created a new material to colour the maze walls.
-Built maze walls for prototype maze.
-Built separate 'start' and 'goal' areas. 
 -Includes creating two addtional materials to colour them.
-Created the script for managing the maze's rotations.
-Tested the ball's collisions by rotating the maze about the y-axis at 1 degree
 per frame for 1000 frames.
  -The ball 'jitters' while it's stuck in the rotation but has an appropriate velocity
   after the maze stops rotating.
-Need to create script for actually controlling the maze before building the scene and 
 pushing it to the remote repo (origin).
-Didn't commit any changes

06/04/2018
========================
-Created a .gitignore file and added Temp/ and .vs/ to it
-Commited progress up to this point to the "ProtoWorking" branch
-Implemented temporary controls for rotating the maze about the z-axis.

=========================
-Created a build of progress so far. Found a BUG where the ball isn't colliding properly when
 it first lands on the start floor. The initial rotation results in the ball clipping through the floor.
 However, the collisions occur as they should after a some rotations.
-The BUG occurs when the ball's transform becomes static.
-Created a script for the initial bounce when the game starts but it does not solve the problem (see above
 point) and the script is obsolete since physics materials can be easily created in the Unity editor.
-Created a script for the ball movement to apply a continuous downward force of 980 units/second (i.e. gravity)
 rather using the 'Use Gravity' in the editor. This seems to have fixed the bug for the moment.
-Implemented buttons for rotation about the x-axis.
-Tested and completed the maze in the editor. No bugs found but due to the ball and corridors'
 relative widths, movement along corridors is not smooth.
-Scaled ball down to 0.8 of its original size.
-Built and playtested. Same results as playtesting in the editor.
